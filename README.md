# Simple-Linear-Regression-Student-CGPA-Dataset-

### **📌 Simple Linear Regression on Placement Dataset**  

**Simple Linear Regression** is a basic **machine learning algorithm** used to find the **relationship** between an **independent variable (input)** and a **dependent variable (output)**.  

In this project, we analyze the relationship between **students' CGPA and their placement salary** using **linear regression**. 📊  

---  

## **📁 Project Overview**  
This project explores a **placement dataset** to understand how students' **CGPA** impacts their **salary**.  

🔹 **Key Steps:**  
✔️ **Load the dataset** 📂  
✔️ **Visualize the data** 📊  
✔️ **Train a Simple Linear Regression model** 🤖  
✔️ **Make predictions and evaluate the model** 📉  
✔️ **Plot the regression line**

## **📌 What is Simple Linear Regression?**  
Linear Regression is a **statistical technique** that finds the **best-fit straight line** for a given set of data points.  

It follows the mathematical equation:  

\[
Y = mX + b
\]  

Where:  
✅ `Y` = Predicted Salary (Dependent Variable)  
✅ `X` = CGPA (Independent Variable)  
✅ `m` = Slope (How much salary changes with CGPA)  
✅ `b` = Intercept (Salary when CGPA is zero)

## **📊 Dataset Description**  

This dataset consists of two key features:  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `CGPA` | Students' **Cumulative Grade Point Average** |
| `Salary` | **Placement salary** received after graduation |

The **goal** is to **predict salary based on CGPA**.

## **📈 How Does It Work?**  

1️⃣ **Load and Visualize Data**  
- Read the dataset and understand its structure.  
- Use **scatter plots** to see the relationship between CGPA and Salary.  

2️⃣ **Split Data into Training & Testing Sets**  
- Divide the dataset into **training and testing** parts.  

3️⃣ **Train the Model**  
- Use **Linear Regression** to train the model.  

4️⃣ **Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model**  
- Predict salaries using the test data.  
- Check **accuracy** using **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score**.  

5️⃣ **Plot the Regression Line**  
- Use **matplotlib** to visualize the **best-fit line**.

## **💡 Key Learnings**  
✅ There is a **positive relationship** between CGPA and Salary.  
✅ **Linear Regression** is a simple yet powerful technique used in real-world scenarios.  
✅ Using **evaluation metrics** helps understand how well the model performs.
